Easy Shop Application Version 2 Overview
New Features:

C.R.U.D Operations: The updated version of the Easy Shop application now allows you to perform Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations on categories and items. This means you have more control over managing the categories and items in the application. You can create new categories or items, search for specific items or categories using their respective IDs, update and edit any item or category, and delete items or categories as needed.

Filtering by Item Type: The application now provides the ability to filter and display items based on their item type. This feature allows you to easily find items that belong to a specific category or type. For example, if you are looking for electronics, you can apply the filter to only show electronics-related items, making it more convenient to browse through the available products.

Automatic Listing: Upon loading the application, the items are now automatically listed in ascending order. This enhancement simplifies the browsing experience by presenting the items in a sorted manner, making it easier to navigate through the available products.

Fixed Bugs:

Price Filtering Bug: In the previous version, there was a bug that caused incorrect filtering of prices when specifying a range from the minimum to the maximum price. This bug has been resolved in Version 2. Now, you can accurately filter items based on the desired price range, ensuring that you find the products that fit your budget.

Item Duplication Bug: In the previous version, there was a bug that caused item duplication when attempting to edit and update an item. This issue has been fixed in Version 2. Now, when you update an item, it is correctly modified without any duplication, ensuring the integrity of the data and preventing unnecessary duplication errors.

With these new features and bug fixes, Easy Shop Application Version 2 provides an improved user experience, giving you more control over managing categories and items, better filtering options, and a smoother browsing experience.
